    <h1>The Case for Quantum Computing</h1>
    <h3>by Saif Awan</h3>
    <p>Leading computer scientists have talked about the immense potential of quantum computing for decades.
        Should we be paying more attention? Should we be reallocating resources to the field?
        In this essay I will make the case for quantum computing and what is possible in the near future.

    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p>In 1965, Gordon Moore, engineer and founder of the Intel Corportation, made the prediction that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit would double every year. This is a prediction about the increase in computational power of computers every year. This prediction was accurate during the early years of computing and has been revised now to a doubling of transistors every 18 months. 
        The size of a single atom is the hard limit for how small a transistor can ever be, and that bound might be reached by 2030. The solution to the limits of classical computing and classical physics is quantum computing and quantum physics.

        A classical computer performs operations using bits which can represent two states, 0 or 1. This classical computer can be defined as a Turing Machine after Alan Turing a pioneer of computing in the early 20th century. A quantum computer performs operations using qubits which can represent the state 0 or 1 or a superposition of 0 and 1. The superpositon of 0 and 1 means that the state is between the two and can be represented as a certain percent at each. 
        Qubits represent atomic units like photons, electrons, and other quantum particles that can act as memory and processors.
