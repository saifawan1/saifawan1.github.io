    <h1>The Case for Quantum Computing</h1>
    <h3>by Saif Awan</h3>
    <img src="quantum.jpeg" alt="superposition" style="width:750px;height:400px;">
    <p>Leading computer scientists have talked about the immense potential of quantum computing for decades.
        Should we be paying more attention? Should we be reallocating resources to the field?
        In this essay I will make the case for quantum computing and what is possible in the near future.
     </p>
    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p>In 1965, Gordon Moore, engineer and founder of the Intel Corportation, made the prediction that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit would double every year. This is a prediction about the increase in computational power of computers every year. This prediction was accurate during the early years of computing and has been revised now to a doubling of transistors every 18 months. The size of a single atom is the hard limit for how small a transistor can ever be, and that bound might be reached by 2030. The solution to the limits of classical computing and classical physics is quantum computing and quantum physics. 
    </p>
    <p>A classical computer performs operations using bits which can represent two states, 0 or 1. This classical computer can be defined as a Turing Machine after Alan Turing a pioneer of computing in the early 20th century. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Quantum computing is a new model of computation based on quantum mechanics. A quantum computer performs operations using qubits which can represent the state 0 or 1 or a superposition of 0 and 1. The superpositon of 0 and 1 means that the state is between the two and can be represented as a probability. Qubits represent atomic units like photons, electrons, and other quantum particles that can act as memory and processors. The usefulness of qubits arises from the sheer amount of data they can define and consequently the size of the computational problems that can be tackled. 
    </p>
    <h4> Arguments</h4>
    <p>
        I am arguing that we are at the cusp of a quantum revolution and more people should be in favor of quantum computing research. Three reasons to be optimistic about the future of quantum computing are the google's quantum supremacy project, big breakthroughs in qubit numbers, and the strides made in error correction. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Quantum supremacy is the point in quantum computing development when a quantum computer can solve a problem that no traditional computer can solve. In October 2019, Google announced that their quantum computer performed a specific, well-defined calculation, that is beyond the capability of a classical computer. Google claims that the same calculation would take a classical computer thousands of years to complete. This is a tipping point for quantum computing research that has not gotten enough recognition. What Google has done is provided the first experimental evidence that speeding up quantum computers to massive scales is possible. Google's quantum computer was made up of 53 qubits, a number that is still too low for useful quantum computers. Other companies working on quantum research, such as IBM, have challenged Google's claim of reaching quantum supremacy, however I think that we can safely say that challenges like this are just a way to dismiss an achievement by a competitor in the space. Most researchers acknowledge Google's acomplishment.

        Qubits are the building blocks of quantum computers. However controlling qubits in a computer is an incredibly difficult task and therefore its difficult to build computers with large numbers of qubits. Fortunately, in 2021 IBM announced that they finally exceeded the 100 qubit mark with their new 127 bit quantum computer. Following IBM's announcement, QuEra, a startup working with Harvard researchers, announced that they made a 256 qubit quantum computer. This means that scientists are making drastic breakthroughs in the number of qubits they can fit on a computer chip. Google predicts that they can reach 1,000,000 qubits on a chip by 2029, which many say is the amount of qubits required to get a working quantum computer for practical use cases. 
    </p>
    <p>
        A principle challenge for quantum computing is measuring qubits. Measuring the state of a qubit is a challenge because directly measuring a qubit can destroy the information they contain. To solve this issue researchers have devised a method to indirectly measure the states of qubits through a process called error-correction. This idea of error-correction is a way to make quantum computers more reliable and fault-tolerant due to the volatile state of qubits. In October 2021, researchers at University of Maryland proved that they could implement an error-correction code technique named the Bacon-Shor code on a real full machine. This breakthrough is profound for the field because error correction has beent he greatest challenge for researchers and now a first viable solution for error correction has been implemented and is already being improved upon by other research labs internationally.

    <h4>Challenge and Rebuttal</h4>
    <p>
        Those who challenge the progress of quantum computing claim that we still need far more qubits than we currently have to form a working quantum computer that can be used to solve practical modern problems that classical computers cannot. However there have been arguments made by companies like Microsoft that even 100 qubits can be used to solve practical problems. I think Microsofts argument is a weak one but still relevant to the discussion. IBM also announced that they will have a commerically viable quantum computer with 256 qubits by 2023. A more convincing argument is that the pessimistic  arguments are based on the current state of quantum computers and have not taken into account the sum of all the recent and potentail breakthroughs. Error-correction coding algorithms are being improved and new algorithms are being researched which may require exponentailly less qubits. Scientists have also argued that error-correction isn't even necessary for quantum supremacy. Progress is not linear and any breakthrough in algorithms and design can radically change the future of the field. 
    </p>

    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>
        The field of quantum computing may be thrown into the forefront of public life very soon. As computer scientists we are in a unique position to understand and work closely with this new technology and explore what can be done with it. I hope myself and all my peers make a big impact in the space.
